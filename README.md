#Wellspring Project:

An open letter to the FOSS community at large.

I have a dream.  I have seen a decentralized world that is free and open.  In this world everyone can create and iterate limitlessly.  The pieces required to bring this dream to life already exist; it just requires that they be put together in the correct arrangement.  Grab a beverage and prepare the space around you for a completely mind-blowing idea.  And this is the SHORT version... trust me.

To do this idea justice I must start from where it began for me.  I have dreamt of becoming a fantasy and sci-fi writer for many years.  I was inspired by several authors, including Anne McCaffery and John DeChancie.  At one point I even contacted John to inquire about writing a story within one of his worlds and sending it to him.  That is when I was confronted with the harsh reality of copyright and how it stifles iterative and fan works.

Fast forward a decade or so to find me neck deep in my second decade of building up my own fictional world that started as a Dungeons and Dragons campaign while my wife was furiously pounding out a fan-fic story.  Then it hit me; if I made my own private, opt-in group with a permissive licensing scheme I could build a community that would iterate and flesh out this world faster than even I could dream it up.  

Understanding the fan-fic concept, I knew that I could selectively pick fan stories to become cannon or, within the iterative controls of the license, re-incorporate parts of their works into my own.  I could easily imagine having social features in the web service so that the community would rate works and any that met certain criteria would automatically be published via Amazon and royalties divided among the authors (getting the biggest part), artists, reviewers, and editors.  We would require self-policing to avoid external copyright issues, so even rating needs to be incentivised.

And then the ideas forked from there, spreading the idea like wildfire through my imagination.  It was never meant to be limited to written works.  At first I was daydreaming of a VR MMO based on my world having seen early peeks at what later became the Oculus Rift.  I thought it could be funded from part of the proceeds of digital publishing...  But wait, if I have social features, why not allow contract services backed by community ratings?  

The next fork hit when I realized that it would be possible to compete directly against Amazon thanks to ideas like Etherium:  Why limit it to just writing?  It would be (relatively) simple to add store features on the contracts, thus allowing anyone to run their own store.  Given the nature of the original idea I quickly realized I would also be cutting into ETC and other markets.  

Then I joined the beta for EQ Next (Landmark) and started a whole new series of forks of thought.  Minecraft had been tons of fun, but to make it visually appealing on top of the creative power of Mojang's masterpiece?  Wow.  

Along the way I realized that if the currency of this platform were individual voxels, it would create an entirely new market for digital goods.  Props, maps, and even entire games could reside within this one interface.  But how to distribute them fairly?  PvP!  If random matches of the top rated(?) games were to make use of the CPUs of the participants at the end of their match (or even as sub-threads during) it would allow automated scaling of block confirmation and reward the players, with the winners getting double the reward.

That is when the wildfire melted my brain.  Using voxels one could create entire studios to record animated features, possibly even choose your own adventure VR movies and the like.  The iterative licensing would also encourage many actors to join or rent mo-cap studios to record their versions of performances and license their individual performances out.  Suddenly I had 'choose your favorite actor ala-carte' per movie.  With blockchain ownership of digital assets the community would soon have the resources needed to create just about anything from a drag and drop menu in record time within VR.  

Netflix, YouTube, Hollywood, Valve, Epic, Discord, and any other publishing platform - You're all on the list too.  We aren't just an audience.  Unshackled from antiquated copyright laws, we will outstrip all of the gatekeepers in volume and quality (which is subjective anyway).  Forget the race to the bottom, welcome to micro-transaction based digital asset ownership the FOSS way.  Everyone has the opportunity to contribute and the blockchain will ensure they receive fair compensation and contribution credit.

What do we need to make this idea a reality?  I see there being a few essential components (in no particular order):

A decentralized interface
A ledger of ownership levels (original creator, iterative creator, etc) and reviews
A voxel building engine(s) compatable with mobile, desktop, and VR that creates owned assets (it can release the voxels once the object is confirmed)
Libraries to drag and drop controls into an environment (ex. Scoring systems, FPS controls, RTS controls, MOBA controls, animation, etc)

Once we have these building blocks in place we can start alpha testing.  I originally made many design choices that have been omitted here.  While I have my opinion on these choices I realize that they should be debated to ensure the best product comes of the effort.

I look forward to hearing from any and all who are ready to contribute to this Wellspring project.  Let's make the content of the world FOSS... er,FOSC?
